This is the video I started with about a year ago when I was trying to learn to code. Just landed my first programming job yesterday.

For those who wanted to know more about my journey:

I started teaching myself web dev while in school for computer science a few weeks before my second semester of college. Over the next like 6 months, I kept learning and making projects. I taught myself in this order: HTML, CSS, JS, React, Node using Express.js, then PostgreSQL. 

Before I started teaching myself, the only experience I had with programming was an intro to programming class in college where we learned the fundamentals of programming using Java. I really didn’t do much programming in school during my first year of college. Other than that, I learned everything else about programming through YouTube videos. I thought learning web dev could help me build my resume and get some internships. I wasn’t planning on applying to jobs while I was still in school at first.

After that, i kinda stopped programming outside of school for a while because tbh i kinda got a little burnt out. 

A few months later, two weeks before the second semester of my sophomore year, I started applying to part-time remote web dev jobs because I didn’t get any internships. Eventually, I got accepted into a job making $18 an hour working part-time, which isn’t a huuuge amount for a web dev job, but great money for a broke college student.

I work in front-end. My job only really requires me to use HTML, CSS, and JS. I work with a small team making educational games on the web for K-12 students.

The grind really sucked, but I guess it paid off in the end? I just remember just studying and coding every day for hours until my brain hurt. One of the hardest things I’ve done. It sucked big time. Just glad that grind is over
